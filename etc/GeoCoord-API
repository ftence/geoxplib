API requests are all signed using a HMAC-SHA256 scheme.

Data to be signed is comprised of:

Request Method (either GET or POST) + crlf
Request URI + crlf
Sorted name '=' value parameters where name and value are % encoded with a charset of UTF-8 + crlf

All parameters except 'sig' MUST be included in the data to be signed.

A parameter named 'ts' MUST be present and contain the timestamp at which the request was sent,
expressed in milliseconds since the epoch. This timestamp WILL be checked to determine if API requests are valid or not.

A parameter named 'id' MUST be present, it will contain either a 'gcuid' (GeoCoord User ID) or 'gclid' (GeoCoord Layer ID) depending on the API request.


API requests are:


* Layer related

/layer/create

  @param id  UUID of the requesting user
  @param ts  timestamp at which the request was signed
  @param sig signature of the request with the secret associated with gcuid
  @param name name to give to the layer, MUST be unique across all layers or user

  Layer URL is layer/<Layer Name> or layer/<Layer UUID>
  
  By using the name, and playing with /layer/update/name it is possible to have 'virtual' layers, i.e. a static name that
  points to several layers at various times (for example current/previous).

/layer/delete - Delete an entire layer (including its content)

  @param id  UUID of the layer to remove
  @param ts  timestamp at which the request was signed
  @param sig signature of the request with the secret associated with the layer

/layer/dump - Dump the content of a layer

  @param id  UUID of the layer to dump
  @param ts  timestamp at which the request was signed
  @param sig signature of the request with the secret associated with the layer

/layer/update/name - Rename a layer

  @param id  UUID of the layer to rename
  @param ts  timestamp at which the request was signed
  @param sig signature of the request with the secret associated with the layer
  @param name New name to give the layer, MUST be unique for the given user
   
/layer/update/secret - Change the secret associated with a layer

  @param id   UUID of the layer to rename
  @param ts   timestamp at which the request was signed
  @param sig  signature of the request with the current secret associated with the layer
  @param sig2 signature of the request with the new secret associated with the layer
  @param name New name to give the layer, MUST be unique for the given user

/path/create
/path/delete
/path/update

/zone/create
/zone/update
/zone/delete

/point/create - Create a point

  id: gclid of the layer to include the point in
  ts: timestamp
  sig: signature of the request with the secret associated with gclid

  gcname: name of point, MUST be unique for the given gclid
  gclat: latitude in decimal degrees
  gclon: longitude in decimal degrees
  gcalt: altitude in decimal meters
  gctags: tags which will be searchable (with stemming and all)
  gctext: textual description of point
  gcurl: url to a page describing this point more thoroughly
  gcicon: url of icon to display
  gcvalue: value between 0.0 and 1.0 (will serve for heat maps)
  
  attr:value pairs, as many attr:value pairs as wanted, those will be searchable verbatim (i.e. attr:value)
  
  The total amount of data for each point cannot exceed 1 kilobyte (as measured by our serialization process)
     
/point/delete

/point/update

  id: gcpid of the point to modify
  gclid: gclid of the layer the point is in
  ts: timestamp
  sig: signature of the request with the secret associated with gclid
  type: replace/delta
  
  new attribute values. Those will replace the current ones if type is 'replace', otherwise they will be added to the current ones, unless value is empty in which case the matching attribute will be removed (all values if several existed).
